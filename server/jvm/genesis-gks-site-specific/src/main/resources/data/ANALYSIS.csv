"VOD","John Smith","Neutral","Hold","Neutral","8.40","4.70","5.20","6.10","Vodafone operates mobile and fixed-line networks and businesses in more than 20 countries. Its largest market is Germany, where it is the second mobile operator after Deutsche Telekom and owns a cable network after acquiring Kabel Deutschland in 2013 and Liberty Global Germany in 2019. In the U.K. and Italy, it acts as a mobile operator, while in Spain it offers converged services after the acquisition of cable operator Ono in 2014. Vodafone also has operations in several Central European and African countries, which combined represent around one third of revenue.","Vodafone has historically been a mobile player, but during the last decade it has carried out several deals to solidify its fixed-line presence. Vodafone is the owner of the cable network in Germany, thanks to the acquisitions of Kabel Deutschland (2013) and Liberty Global Germany (2019). These moves made Germany Vodafone’s largest market by revenue, a decision we support, given the historical price stability in this geography."
"LSEG","John Smith","Neutral","StrongBuy","Negative","4.50","5.10","4.30","4.63","London Stock Exchange Group is a fully integrated financial exchange company covering the financial market value chain from primary and secondary markets across multiple asset classes over data, index and analytics down to clearing and post-trading reporting. With the acquisition of Refinitiv, LSEG generates about two thirds of its revenue from data and analytics including its FTSE Russell and WMRefinitiv benchmarks as well as data feeds and terminals. The group is also a majority shareholder in Tradeweb, one of the dominant global fixed income trading venues, as well as LCH, the largest clearing house for over-the-counter swaps globally.","The London Stock Exchange Group, or LSEG, has doubled down on its market data and analytics strategy. After the Refinitiv acquisition, the new group is now vertically integrated from pretrading data and analytics over trading venues down to post-trade clearing and reporting, albeit dominated by its data business. Importantly, its assets form a strong symbiotic relationship wherein intellectual property generated within one strengthens the offering of the other, inducing demand for the group’s services."
"LLOY","John Smith",Neutral,"ModerateBuy","Neutral","6.15","4.35","7.10","5.87","Lloyds is a retail and commercial bank headquartered in the United Kingdom. The bank operates via three business segments: retail, commercial banking, and insurance and wealth. In retail, Lloyds offers primarily mortgages (66% of loan portfolio), credit cards, and current accounts to its customers. Its commercial banking operation provides lending, transaction banking, working capital management, and debt capital market services to large corporates and financial institutions in the U.K. Insurance and wealth rounds out the product lineup with life and property insurance as well as pension solutions and high-net-worth asset-management services.","Lloyds is a pure U.K. banking play, with 95% of its assets based domestically. Since its massive restructuring, which started in 2011, the bank has emerged as a low-risk domestic retail and commercial bank. It has shed about GBP 190 billion in runoff assets and GBP 200 billion in risk-weighted assets and has significantly reduced its dependence on wholesale funding. Today, Lloyds operates one of the strongest retail franchises in the United Kingdom."
"BP","John Smith","Overperform","ModerateBuy","Neutral","2.50","5.80","6.10","4.80","BP is an integrated oil and gas company that explores for, produces, and refines oil around the world. In 2022, it produced 1.1 million barrels of liquids and 6.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. At the end of 2022, reserves stood at 7.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 56% of which are liquids. The company operates refineries with a capacity of 1.6 million barrels of oil per day. BP also holds a 20% ownership interest in Rosneft, which it plans to exit.","BP previously expected to reduce production by 25% by 2025 and 40% by 2030, but it will now increase production slightly through 2025 and reduce it by about 25% from 2019 levels by 2030, largely through divestments. During that time, it should also improve upstream profitability as higher-margin volumes from major projects come online and costs are reduced."
